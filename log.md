# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 12 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** I've started the 100 Days Of Code challenge. I decided to spend today regaining familiarity with algorithms. Started on the [Repeated String Match](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/description/) problem on leetcode

**Thoughts:** I've deliberated on whether it is a good idea to start this challenge while I am about to begin traveling with family. However, I figured that if I were to continue this as a habit, now is as good a time as anytime. I definitely feel rusty about my algorithms skills (I did not finish the problem in the given time), I feel motivated to give it another shot tomorrow.
