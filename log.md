# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 12 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** I've started the 100 Days Of Code challenge. I decided to spend today regaining familiarity with algorithms. Started on the [Repeated String Match](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/description/) problem on leetcode

**Thoughts:** I've deliberated on whether it is a good idea to start this challenge while I am about to begin traveling with family. However, I figured that if I were to continue this as a habit, now is as good a time as anytime. I definitely feel rusty about my algorithms skills (I did not finish the problem in the given time), I feel motivated to give it another shot tomorrow.

### Day 2: May 13 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** I've completed the [Repeated String Match](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/description/) problem on Leetcode. I've also read chapter 1-6 of [Effective Java](https://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=effective+java+3rd+edition&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=241870396956&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15289863680142790049&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030795&hvtargid=kwd-13181264399&ref=pd_sl_5dar4okm7z_e)

**Thoughts:** R1D2: Today, my laptop died on day 2 of #100DaysOfCode. Thankfully I managed to grab a hold of a laptop to finish up Repeated String Match after a day of thoughts. It feels good to shake off the algorithm rust! Additionally, I've also managed to read 5 chapters of Effective Java!

**Today's Progress:** I've completed the [K Empty Slots](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/google/67/sql-2/470/) problem on Leetcode. 
**Thoughts:** R1D3: Today for #100DaysOfCode , I finished the K-Empty Slots problem on Leetcode. After spending time understanding the premise, I managed to brute-force a solution. After about an hour, I managed to write a Sliding-Window solution. I think I've had enough flowers for the day ðŸ˜…
