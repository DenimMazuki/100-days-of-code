# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will either read or do code related preparation for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
May 12th, 2018.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress. This does not apply if there are no pushable contents
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, and practice algorithms. I consider time spent doing tutorials and reading documentations as fair game.
