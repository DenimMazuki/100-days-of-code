## Motivations
I joined this challenge to push myself to build a healthy habit of taking an hour daily to build external skills.

By the end of the challenge, I hope to have:
1. Improved my Java/Scala skills
2. Improved and regain confidence in my Data Structure and Algorithm skills
3. Write and blog on projects and other interesting informations
